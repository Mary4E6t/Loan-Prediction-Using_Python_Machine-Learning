                                                                  Aim

Our aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & numPy libraries from python to extract insights from the data libraries for machine learning.

Secondly, in order to predict whether the loan applicant can repay the loan or not using Decision Tree Classifier and naive bayes classifier to improve the accuracy.

Attributes in the dataset

Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Property Area, Loan Status

                                                         Major observation from the data

Male applicants are more than female applicants.

Applicants who are male and are graduated have more applicant income over the applicants who have not graduated.

Applicants who are male and married tends to have more applicant income whereas applicant who are female and married have least applicant income.

Again, the applicants who are married and graduated have the more applicant income.

Applicants who are not self-employed have more applicant income than the applicants who are self-employed.

Applicants who have property in urban and have credit history have maximum applicant income

Applicants who are graduate and have credit history have more applicant income.

From heatmaps, applicant income and loan amount are highly positively correlated.

Applicants who have graduated are more than applicants who did not graduate.

Property area is to be find more in semi urban areas and minimum in rural areas
